> “Shadow Banned” isn’t just what happened to the album.
> It’s what happened to the truth — silenced, but not erased.

## 🌐 Introduction

*Shadow Banned* is a sonic field report from digital exile.  
A defiant manuscript written under the flicker of deplatformed dreams and blacklisted signal.  
Not sold — broadcasted. Not hyped — suppressed. And yet… here it is.

## 🧠 Psychological Framing

This album is not a playlist — it’s a **neural disruption protocol**.  
Each track is a memory fragment disguised as a bar.  
A weaponized lyric, fired through the speaker as insurgent code.

## 🧱 Structural Notes

- **13 Tracks** — corresponding to lunar occult cycles.
- **Track 6** (“Spiteful Poetry”) is the tonal pivot. It holds the key to Hawk Eye’s symbolic inversion.
- **Final track** (“Krystal Klear”) is both a cipher and declaration — “You missed nothing. I said it all.”

## 🧬 Metaphysical Layer

Shadow Banned is the byproduct of Hawk Eye’s **incarnated defiance**.  
Every word bears witness to a reality the system denies exists.

- Psychic trauma decoded.
- Surveillance culture mocked.
- False prophets named, and slain with syllables.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This wasn’t made to chart.  
It was made to survive — until someone like you unearthed it.

Welcome to the forbidden archive.
